Angular app
====================

AngularJS is a JavaScript MVC framework developed by Google.<br/>
I decided to write my own AngularJS app. For this demo I was using locale translate, storage, node.js server, grunt and bower task runners, karma & jasmine (unit testing) and protractor (e2e testing). <br/>
All config files you may find in the root folder.

### Getting Started
To begin we need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager) for install task runners [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). <br/>
Before setting up Grunt ensure that your npm is up-to-date by running *npm update -g npm* (this might require sudo on certain systems). <br/>
After that install Grunt and Bower globaly.
```html
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
```html
npm install -g bower
```
